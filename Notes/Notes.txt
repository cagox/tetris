I have the basics of keyboard inputs figured out.

I need to figure out how to create a shape.
I need to figure out how to rotate a shape.
I need to figure out how to move a shape.
I need to figure out how to make sure the shape does not colide with other shapes.
I need to check for full lines and delete them, then lower everything above them.

Feature Requests:
 * My son has requested that I add a "block saver" feature, allowing him to store a block for later use.




SDL_Rect    demoRect;
Set dimensions of rect:
    demoRect.x = 150;
    demoRect.y = 350;
    demoRect.h = 100;
    demoRect.w = 100;

Removed from Render code:
    SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(tetrisRenderer, 250, 10, 10, SDL_ALPHA_OPAQUE);
    SDL_RenderFillRect(tetrisRenderer, &demoRect); // Returns 0 on success. Add error checking later.
